              Delicate flowers gathered from meadows in Germany and later from
              the Louisiana bayous were carefully pressed between the pages of
              books and journals. Though their colors softened with age, they
              preserved cherished memories of places the Schexnaydre family
              called home.

              <p>
                Adelheid often gathered wildflowers during walks through the
                countryside of Württemberg. Rather than allowing their beauty to
                fade with the seasons, she carefully pressed the blossoms
                between sheets of paper, preserving small reminders of peaceful
                days spent beneath open skies.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before the family's journey to Louisiana, several of these
                flowers were tucked safely among their treasured belongings.
                Years later, new blossoms collected from the bayous were added
                beside the originals, creating a living collection that told the
                story of two homelands connected through memory.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each pressed flower represents a specific moment in the family's
                history. Some commemorate joyful celebrations, while others were
                gathered during times of farewell or reflection. Together they
                became a quiet record of life's changing seasons, preserved long
                after the flowers themselves had faded.

              The collection contains flowers gathered from two worlds. Early

              Louisiana's forests, marshes, and bayous. Together they reflect
              the family's journey and the enduring connection between memory,
              nature, and home.

              generation that memories, like flowers, can be carefully
              protected and passed forward through time.
